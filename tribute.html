		<h2>Early Life and Schooling</h2>
		<p>Malala Yousafzai was born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, a small town in the Swat district of 
        Pakistan. She grew up in a family that was passionate about education, and her father Ziauddin Yousafzai 
        was a school owner and educational activist. Malala attended her father's school and was an excellent student,
        showing a keen interest in politics and social issues from an early age.</p>
		<p>However, in 2007, the Taliban began to gain control of the Swat Valley, and they banned girls from
         attending school. Malala refused to be silenced, and she began to speak out publicly against the Taliban's
        oppressive regime, writing a blog for the BBC about her experiences and advocating for girls' education.</p>
